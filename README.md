Credits;

I obtained the linear gradient code from the following page;
http://lea.verou.me/2011/03/beveled-corners-negative-border-radius-with-css3-gradients/
I tweeked this code to overcome the fact that CSS does not allow for negative values to be entered for border-radius & used this to round my four coloured buttons.

I obtained the button audio files by downloading a video of the simon game & converting into mp3.  I then used the enclosed cutting tool (https://mp3cut.net/) to isolate each button sound & save it to it's own mp3 file.
